# SkillLinker

SkillLinker is a simple web-based service marketplace prototype. It allows users to discover, offer, and connect for a wide variety of services, from gardening and cooking to software development. This MVP is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy customization and rapid prototyping.

## Features

- **Home Page:** Introduction and navigation
- **Service Listings:** View a grid of available services, each with images and details
- **Login/Register Demo:** Static authentication forms (demo only)
- **Profile Pages:** Example provider and user profiles with service info and contact option
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox

## How to Run

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
2. **Place your images** in the project root (e.g., `gardener.jpg`, `developer.jpg`, etc.)
3. **Open `index.html`** in any modern browser

_No server or build process is required – it's a static site!_

## Folder Structure

```
/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── main.js
├── gardener.jpg
├── developer.jpg
├── cooking.jpg
└── yourphoto.jpg
```

## Customization

- **Add or edit service cards** in the `index.html` file under the Service Listings section.
- **Update profile information and images** in the Profile and Provider Profile sections.

## Roadmap
